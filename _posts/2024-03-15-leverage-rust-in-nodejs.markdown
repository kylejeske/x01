Rust and Node.js are both popular tools for backend development. While Node.js excels at I/O-bound tasks, CPU-bound processes can lead to bottlenecks. This is where Rust becomes valuable.

Using the [`neon`](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon) library, Rust can be integrated into Node.js, allowing you to handle heavy computations in Rust while keeping the simplicity of JavaScript for I/O operations.

### Why Use Rust with Node.js?

Rust is known for its memory safety and speed. When you have complex, CPU-intensive tasks, Rust can offload the work that would typically block the event loop in Node.js. Examples include:

- Cryptographic algorithms
- Image processing
- Mathematical computations

### Getting Started

To integrate Rust, you'll need to install `neon` and set up a Rust project. Then, expose the Rust functions to JavaScript. This way, you get the performance benefits of Rust while maintaining Node.js's simplicity.
