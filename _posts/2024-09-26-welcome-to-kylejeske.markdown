# Bit by Bit

## I'm back!

Welcome to my corner of the world. After being offline for nearly a decade, I'm excited to bring this site back to life.

_"Bit by Bit"_ is where I’ll document my journey through coding, technology, and problem-solving, sharing insights and personal projects as I navigate the ever-changing landscape of software development. Whether you’ve been here before or are new, I’m glad to have you along for the ride.
